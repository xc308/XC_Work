## Highly Multivariate Large-scale Spatial Stochastic Processes -- A Cross-Markov Random Field Approach

This repo contains the code for the manuscript, entitled "Highly Multivariate Large-scale Spatial Stochastic Processes -- A Cross-Markov Random Field Approach", by [Xiaoqing Chen](https://sites.google.com/view/xiaoqingchen/home), [Peter Diggle](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/diggle/), [James.V.Zideck](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/james-v-zidek-frsc-oc), [Gavin Shaddick](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=O8brpOcAAAAJ&hl=en).


We propose a cross-MRF model class, consisting of a mixed spatial graphical model framework and a cross-MRF theory to address various challenges of highly multivariate large-scale spatial data collectively within one unified framework. 

The core contribution of the cross-MRF theory is that it realises *doubly* conditional independence (CI) among both p components and n spatial locations, see [here](Assets/4CI.png).

We achieved:
  - utmost sparsity in the joint precision matrix
  - lowest generation order of the joint precision matrix
  - asymmetric cross-correlation in the joint covariance matrix
  - scientific interpretability
